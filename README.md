Engine-du-Elephant
==================

A simple game engine project that i made for college and uploaded here with the intention of improving it.

This code is:
1)A mess
2)Badly written
3)Badly commented
4)Doesnt even work very well.

TODO
==================

URGENT:
1) Impliment "placement new" for all of the entity objects and allocate that menory when map is read in order to hopefully remove the laggy feeling when moving the player entity. (thought to be beacuse of memory acsess times.)


Not so urgent.
1) Remove entitys being hardcoded with rendering code, colour, textures etc. Make it so that there is one entity object type which can be configured in using the map file/s
2) Impliment Lua scripting to configure engine and to program the entities.
3) Add support for textures.
